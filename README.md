# Retail-Sales-Forecasting-and-Customer-Segmentation

### Project Overview:
This project aims to analyze historical retail sales data to forecast future sales and perform customer segmentation for targeted marketing strategies

### Dataset
The dataset contains historical sales data from a retail store, including:
* Sales transactions (date, product ID, quantity sold, sales price)
* Customer information (ID, demographics)
* Product details (category, price, etc.)

### 1. Data Exploration and Preprocessing:
● Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, removing duplicates, and correcting
inconsistencies in the dataset.
● Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Performing exploratory analysis to
understand sales trends, customer behavior, popular products, etc.
● Data Visualization: Creating visualizations (line plots, histograms, etc.) to
showcase sales trends over time, distribution of sales across products or
categories, etc.

### 2. Time Series Forecasting:
● Time Series Analysis: Analyzing sales data to identify seasonality, trends, and
any cyclic patterns.
● Quantitative Forecasting: Applying forecasting model (Exponential Smoothing)
to predict future sales based on historical trends.

### 3. Customer Segmentation:
● Neural Network Classification: Implement a neural network model to
classify customers based on their buying patterns or demographics for
targeted marketing
